# Hybrid Renewable Energy System Modelling & Analysis


## Description
This analysis aims to find the optimum setup of renewable energy facilities in terms of wind turbines, photovoltaics, and storage capacity in two different US locations (Traverse, Michigan and Tucson, Arizona).

## Goals
- Developing a MATLAB model to simulate a hybrid renewable energy system in the two locations to identify cost-effective solutions that maximize renewable energy use in each location.
- Investigating the system's performance metrics (coverage ratio, residual load, unused energy, supply-demand mismatch) based on weather data and load profile.
- Calculating the LCOE and developing scenario analysis to assess the optimum system setting.

#### Specific Investment Cost (SIC):

Electrolysis has a significantly higher SIC (1000 €/kW) compared to steam-methane reforming (530 €/kW). This suggests that the initial capital investment required for electrolysis is substantially greater.

#### Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH):

Electrolysis also has a higher LCOH (30 cent€/kWh) than steam-methane reforming (7.5 cent€/kWh). This indicates that the overall cost of producing hydrogen over its lifetime is significantly lower for steam-methane reforming.

#### CO₂ Emissions:

Electrolysis produces significantly lower CO₂ emissions (11.5 Mn tCO₂e) compared to steam-methane reforming (5.8 Mn tCO₂). This makes electrolysis a more environmentally friendly option.

### Implications:

#### Cost vs. Environmental Impact:
The choice between these two methods involves a trade-off between cost and environmental impact. Steam-methane reforming offers a lower cost but has higher emissions, while electrolysis has higher costs but lower emissions.

#### Technological Advancements: 
As technology advances, the costs and efficiencies of both methods may change. Future developments could potentially reduce the cost gap between electrolysis and steam-methane reforming.

#### Policy and Market Factors: 
Government policies, market demand, and the availability of renewable energy sources can also influence the choice between these methods. For example, incentives for renewable energy can make electrolysis more economically attractive.

### Key Points:

#### Required Renewable Energy Share: 
The analysis indicates that a 64% share of renewables in the energy mix is necessary. This suggests a significant shift towards cleaner energy sources is required.

#### CO₂ Tax Requirement: 
A CO₂ tax of 77.5 cent€/kgCO₂ is proposed. This carbon pricing mechanism aims to equalize the LCOH for both processes, making the electrolyis process more competitive.

### Implications:

#### Transition to Renewables: 
Achieving a 64% renewable energy share will necessitate substantial investments in renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and hydropower.

#### Economic Impact: 
Implementing a CO₂ tax could have economic implications, potentially leading to higher energy costs for consumers and businesses. However, it can also drive innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies.

#### Environmental Benefits: 
Both the increased share of renewables and the CO₂ tax can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change.

#### Policy Implications: 
Achieving these goals will likely require a combination of policies, including subsidies for renewable energy, regulations to reduce carbon emissions, and international cooperation.
Conclusion:

## Final Thoughts
While steam-methane reforming currently offers a more cost-effective option, the environmental benefits of electrolysis make it a promising alternative, especially as renewable energy sources become more accessible and affordable. The future of hydrogen production will likely involve a mix of both methods, with the optimal choice depending on specific factors such as location, energy costs, and environmental regulations.
